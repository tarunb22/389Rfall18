### Part 2 (75 pts)

As a junior developer my job was to specifically check the current firmware for security issues. Since I have found some issues, the first person to tell in this situation would be a superior, or my boss. As a junior developer I did my job in finding a security issue and the proper course of action would be to elevate it to a higher up. If my company is unwilling to postpone the ECU's release to get the issue fixed, then it is a different issue. Personally, if nothing is done and the faulty ECU firmware is pushed then if harm was to occur I would feel personally responsible as I was the first one to discover the issue and nothing was done. My course of action would definitely be to try and tell anyone above me within the company that the issue has to be fixed, even going around my boss to someone higher if need be. If the company refuses to take action on the issue, at this point I would most likely consider going to a consumer watchdog. The issue with this is that I could possible be skirting the law as I would most likely not be allowed to disclose information outside the company which is why I would try to go around my immediate superior first. While it may be breaking the terms of my contract, I would still most likely report this to a consumer watchdog because I feel that it is wrong to let something that could harm people go unfixed. I would not take something like this public unless it was an absolute last resort, releasing information like that could also hurt the possibility of me getting another job as while I was doing the write thing, I am in a sense acting as a whistleblower and no company wants to hire someone who is not loyal to them.
